# SRPN-Calculator
Saturated Polish Notation Calculator

A project completed as part of my MSc Computer Science program at The University of Bath, I received a grade of 80% for this piece of work.

Access to a legacy system SRPN calculator was given and no documentation was provided. The task was investigative and required the functionality of the calculator to be found through trial and error with the aim of replicating as much of the functionality as possible.

The original SRPN that I needed to replicate can be found here: https://repl.it/@bathuniversity/sprn-to-emulate#main.sh

A fun project that you could spend an eternity playing with. The task allowed a test-driven approach and focus was made on providing well documented, readable code.
